# üå± Proof of Impact DAO ‚Äî A Hyperlocal Carbon ReFi Marketplace using Web3

### Presented At: Hack With Gujarat 2025 (May 26‚Äì29, 2025), hosted virtually on Devfolio.

---

## üß© Problem Statement

The global carbon credit ecosystem currently faces several critical challenges:

- **Greenwashing and Fraud**: Many carbon offsets are unverifiable or inflated, eroding trust.
- **Exclusion of Local Projects**: Small-scale, community-based initiatives find it difficult to access the carbon market due to complex processes and high entry barriers.
- **Lack of Transparency**: Buyers cannot trace or validate the carbon credits they purchase.
- **Centralized Bureaucracy**: Over-reliance on centralized validation discourages decentralization and inclusiveness.

---

## ‚úÖ Proposed Solution

**Proof of Impact DAO** is a Web3-powered decentralized platform that combats these issues by enabling **hyperlocal environmental projects** to tokenize their impact as **Proof-of-Impact NFTs**, validated through **Decentralized Identities (DIDs)** and **Verifiable Credentials (VCs)**. These NFTs can be traded on a transparent, DAO-governed **ReFi marketplace**, ensuring verified ecological benefits.

---

## üöÄ Key Features & Architecture

### üîê Decentralized Identity (DIDs) & Verifiable Credentials (VCs)

- **DID Registration**: Unique decentralized identity for community members, project owners, and validators.
- **VC Issuance**: Trusted oracles (e.g., NGOs, universities) issue VCs verifying ecological actions (e.g., tree planting, soil health, etc.).

### üßæ Proof-of-Impact NFTs

- **Tokenization**: Verified impact (e.g., 1 ton CO‚ÇÇ sequestered) is tokenized into a unique NFT.
- **Rich Metadata**: Includes geo-location, timestamped VCs, and links to satellite/IoT data.

### üèõÔ∏è DAO Governance

- **Community-Owned**: Governed by stakeholders via a Decentralized Autonomous Organization.
- **On-chain Proposals**: Smart contracts handle project funding, governance changes, and dispute resolution.

### üåç ReFi Carbon Credit Marketplace

- **NFT Transactions**: Tamper-proof carbon offset NFTs are transparently traded.
- **Diverse Buyers**: Individuals, companies, and DAOs can offset emissions by directly supporting local projects.

### ü§ñ AI-Powered Impact Prediction

- **Predictive Model**: Uses OpenAI API to estimate potential ecological benefits from user-submitted data.
- **Smart Suggestions**: Recommends carbon-maximizing strategies based on land/farming data.

### üí¨ Interactive Chatbot

- **Information Hub**: A friendly AI chatbot guides users through DIDs, VCs, NFTs, DAO governance, and more.

## üß† Technologies Used

### üîß Backend

- **Python** ‚Äì Core backend language.
- **Flask** ‚Äì RESTful API server for DIDs, VCs, NFTs, AI, and DAO.
- **OpenAI API** ‚Äì For AI predictions and chatbot functionality.
- **python-dotenv** ‚Äì Securely handles API keys.

### üåê Frontend

- **HTML5 + CSS3** ‚Äì Responsive design with dark-themed, aqua-green UI.
- **JavaScript** ‚Äì Dynamic interactions and API calls.
- **Chart.js** ‚Äì Visualizes market activity and impact.
- **Animate.css** ‚Äì Smooth UI animations.
- **Font Awesome + Google Fonts (Poppins)** ‚Äì Icons and modern typography.

## üåê Web3 Concepts (Mocked for Demo)

To simulate Web3 for MVP purposes, in-memory databases are used:

- **DIDs** ‚Üí `dids_db`
- **VCs** ‚Üí `vcs_db`
- **NFTs** ‚Üí `nfts_db`
- **DAO Voting** ‚Üí `dao_votes_db`

## ‚öôÔ∏è Python Libraries Installation

> Use a virtual environment for safety and isolation:

### Create a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
```
## Activate the environment
### Windows:
```bash
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```
### Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install Flask python-dotenv openai web3
```
uuid and time are built-in python libariries

# Running the Project
## Step-1 Clone the repository
```bash
git clone <your repository-url>
cd proof-of-impact-dao
```
replace <your-repository-url> with your Github repo link
## Step-2 Step up your OpenAI Api key
create a file named key.env.txt and add:
```env
OPEN_API_KEY="YOUR API KEY"
```
Replace "your_openai_api_key_here" with your actual OpenAI API key.
## Step-3 Install dependencies
```bash
pip install Flask python-dotenv openai web3
```
## Step-4 Run the Flask App
```bash
python app.py
```
You should see:
```nignx
Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```
Explore the homepage, dashboard, and marketplace.
